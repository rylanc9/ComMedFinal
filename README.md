# ComMedFinal

Team Members: Austin Marmie, Rylan Celentano

Mods: 
Major - We added a speed boost to our player. when the left shift button is held down, movement speed is
doubled. while the sprint is active stamina goes down and a stamina bar UI icon decreases in color value to
represent its fullness. When empty, the player is not allowed to sprint. The stamina bar regenerates after
2 seconds of not sprinting

Minor -  Added an indicator in real game space that points towards the exit. This indicator has a special 
shader attached to it that draws it above all other objects in the game allowing it to always be viewed.
